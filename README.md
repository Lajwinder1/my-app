# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Docker file explanation

# FROM node:13.12.0-alpine

this command specifies the base image for the docker container and we are using node because it is a lightweight

# WORKDIR /kaur_lajwinder_site

This sets the working directory within the container to /kaur_lajwinder_site, making it the default location for all subsequent commands.

# ENV PATH /kaur_lajwinder_site/node_modules/.bin:$PATH

This command updates the system's PATH environment variable to include the node_modules/.bin directory. This is useful for running locally-installed npm binaries.

# COPY package.json ./
# COPY package-lock.json ./
# RUN npm install --silent
# RUN npm install react-scripts@3.4.1 -g --silent

These lines copy the package.json and package-lock.json files into the container and then run npm install to install the project dependencies. The --silent flag is used to suppress excessive log output during the installation process. Additionally, it installs the react-scripts globally.


# COPY . ./

This copies the application code from the current directory on the host into the container's working directory.

# CMD ["npm", "start"]

This line specifies the default command to run when the container starts. In this case, it runs the npm start command, which typically starts the development server for the React application.

# Running the container

# Buid docker image

docker build -t kaur_lajwinder_coding_assignment11 .

# Run docker container on 7775 port

docker run -p 7775:3000 kaur_lajwinder_coding_assignment11
